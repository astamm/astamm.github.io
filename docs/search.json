I am attached to the Department of Mathematics Jean Leray, a joint CNRS and Nantes University laboratory in Nantes, France. I am also a research fellow at the Computational Radiology Laboratory (CRL) affiliated to the Department of Radiology of Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, MA, USA.\nI am an experienced statistician with focus on (i) the development of novel statistical methodologies for complex image analysis, with extensive but not exclusive application to magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and (ii) the extension of traditional statistical methods (estimation, inference, classification, regression) to the analysis of complex data (functions, Hilbertian, tensors, networks, densities, …).\nI am also a research engineer with particular interest in making methods and algorithms developed in research labs available for use by a broader audience of applied fields. I am the author of several R packages available from my Github page (https://github.com/astamm).\nI was awarded a B.Sc. degree in mathematical engineering from Ecole Centrale de Lyon (France) and a M.Sc. degree in mathematical engineering with major in statistics from Politecnico di Milano (Italy). During the course of my M.Sc., I collaborated with Dept. of Mathematics “F. Brioschi” (MOX) of the Politecnico di Milano and became co-investigator of the 2-year “Pn project” (2009-2010), whose objectives were to enable statistical inference from high-dimensional data. After my M.Sc., I obtained a Ph.D. degree in computer science. My Ph.D. focused on the development and application of statistical models for the study of the brain white matter microstructure and connectivity. During my first post-doctoral appointment at Harvard Medical School, I developed a statistical framework for MR image reconstruction that guarantees unbiasedness of the resulting composite complex MR image. I then joined again the Department of Mathematics of Politecnico di Milano where I pursued the development of novel statistical methodologies for complex image analysis and developed inferential tools for populations of densities and networks.\nSimultaneously, I have been collaborating with the Dept. of Neuroradiology of the University Hospital of Rennes (France), since the beginning of my Ph.D., and with Dept. of Radiology of BCH (USA), since the beginning of my first post-doctoral appointment, to provide guidance on designing experiments and reviewing interim data, and to advise PIs of most of the Dept. projects on all statistical analysis methods and model development required in their projects. During my Ph.D., I also worked as a biostatistician at the Dept. of Epidemiology and Public Health of the University Hospital of Rennes (France) where I was in charge of the statistical analyses of several health-related projects (e.g., multiple sclerosis, practice of oral care in palliative care units).\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nOverview\nThe Large \\(P\\) small \\(n\\) project – or \\(Pn\\) project for short – aims at providing inferential tools for the statistical analysis of data sets characterized by a large number of features observed on a small number of sample units, often referred to in the literature as high-dimensional multivariate data. During the last decades, this kind of data have become very common in many active fields of research, such as medicine, engineering, climatology, and economics. The first application of the newly developed inferential procedures will be the statistical analysis of the brain vascular system with the final goal of detecting statistical associations between geometry, topology, hemodynamic space-time patterns and the onset and rupture of cerebral aneurysms.\nConsortium\nThe scientific team behind the Large \\(P\\) small \\(n\\) project is composed of \\(4\\) researchers from three different institutions:\nName\nRole\nPosition\nInstitution\nSimone Vantini\nPrincipal Investigator\nAssociate Professor in Statistics\nMOX, Department of Mathematics F.

      "description": "A scientific project financed by the Association pour la recherche en Sclérose en Plaques (ARSEP) for studying gait impairment in multiple sclerosis using two sources of information, namely MRI data and sensor data.",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nThe MS-CSI project aims at exploring the relationships between lesion load quantified by MRI and the individual gait pattern (IGP) computed by the eGait device, which is a device jointly developed by the Department of Mathematics Jean Leray (LMJL) and the UmanIT company in Nantes, France.\nRationale\nIn the course of their lifetime, \\(75\\%\\) of patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) complain about reduced mobility due to walking deficiencies. In clinical pratice, gait impairment is evaluated during the clinical exam using mainly three indicators:\nThe time required for a patient to walk twice a distance of \\(25\\) feet; this is the so-called Timed \\(25\\) Foot Walk (T25FW),\nThe walking perimeter of a patient, which is a part of the so-called EDSS score,\nThe cerebral and spinal lesion load, quantified by means of MR imaging.\nThese indicators however do not disentangle the various underlying forms of walking disabilities such as motor impairment, spacticity, equilibrium and so on.\nThe advent and development of connected devices offer a unique opportunity to collect non-invasive quantitative (and thus objective) data about a patient’s health, at minimal cost. The UmanIT company together with the Department of Mathematics Jean Leray (LMJL) have developed a medical device coined eGait paired with a statistical method that generates an individual gait pattern (IGP) using data collected by a motion sensor. The IGP represents the evolution of hip rotation during a typical walking cycle. The IGP represents an objective biomarker of gait impairment that is easily computed from data collected non-invasively and at minimal cost. The scientific hypothesis is that the IGP should share common information about gait impairment be competitive with other\nSpecific Aims\nWe focus in this project on the assessment of gait impairment. The original contributions are:\nto propose a non-invasive low-cost medical device that generates an individual gait pattern for the patient during his/her clinical exam,\nto study the statistical associations between the provided IGP and the lesion load obtained from the MRI data.\nThe project is build on mainly three specific aims:\nSpecific Aim 1\nTo evaluate the statistical associations between the IGP obtained from the sensor data and the lesion load obtained from the MRI data.\n\nSpecific Aim 2\nTo find group-level gait patterns using external sources of information such as lesion load provided by the MRI data or overall disability score provided by the EDSS data.\n\nSpecific Aim 3\nTo explain and predict the lesion load specific to a neuronal pathway or the membership to the previously determined groups, using the IGPs.\n\nMethodology\nPatients from the OFSEP-HD cohort that are seen in the University Hospital either in Nantes or Rennes will be wearing the eGait device during their T25FW test for obtaining their individual gait pattern (we predict \\(100\\) inclusions). As part of the standard protocol of this cohort, a number of demographic and clinical data will be collected as well. In addition, specific cutting-edge MRI sequences will be added as well for quantifying lesion load per neuronal pathway in both the brain and the spinal cord.\nMethods for achieving SA1\nStatistical data integration approaches will be used to explore the statistical association between IGP, clinical data and MRI data. These approaches are meant to integrate different heterogeneous data sources by separating the common and specific information they contain about the phenomenon under study.\n\nMethods for achieving SA2\nClustering methods adapted for functional data will be used. Particular attention will be paid to semi-supervised approaches to account for clinical data and/or MRI data.\n\nMethods for achieving SA3\nFunctional-on-functional regression models will be used for predicting lesion load from the IGP. Scalar-on-functional regression models and supervised classification methods will be used for predicting group membership from the IGP.\n\nChances are that none of the existing statistical approaches will be straightforwardly applicable to deal with our IGP. This is because the IGP is a functional data evaluating in the space of unit quaternion. As a result, a key aspect for achieving our SAs will be to adapt existing or create novel statistical methods that accommodate unit quaternion time series.\nExpected Applications\nThe use of advanced cerebral and spinal MRI methods, not yet used in clinical practice, allows one to quantify lesion load at the granularity of the single neuronal pathway. We ambition:\nto elaborate groupwise gait patterns (GGP) from the quantified lesion load obtained from the MRI data,\nto facilitate the assessment of gait impairment for patients by matching his/her IGP to the closest GGP.\nThis work could have a significant impact since it could provide, during the clinical exam, a specific assessment of gait impairment. This would provide the neurologist with the means to propose dedicated follow-up at early onset of walking deficiencies or even possibly before any symptomatic discomfort. This would ultimately limit or delay aggravated walking deficiencies, which is one of the main fears reported by MS patients.\nConsortium\nThe scientific team behind the MS-CSI project is multidisciplinary and can be divided into \\(4\\) components, the member of which are listed in the tables below.\nComponent 1: Statistical Modeling\nName\nQualification\nAffiliation\nAymeric STAMM\nResearch Engineer in Statistics\nCNRS (LMJL)\nLise BELLANGER\nAssociate Professor in Statistics\nNantes Univ.
