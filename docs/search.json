I am attached to the Department of\nMathematics Jean Leray, a joint CNRS and Nantes University laboratory in\nNantes, France. I am also a research fellow at the Computational\nRadiology Laboratory (CRL) affiliated to the Department of Radiology of\nBoston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, MA, USA.\nI am an experienced statistician with focus on (i) the development of\nnovel statistical methodologies for complex image analysis, with\nextensive but not exclusive application to magnetic resonance imaging of\nthe brain and (ii) the extension of traditional statistical methods\n(estimation, inference, classification, regression) to the analysis of\ncomplex data (functions, Hilbertian, tensors, networks, densities, …).\nI am also a research engineer with particular interest in making methods\nand algorithms developed in research labs available for use by a broader\naudience of applied fields. I am the author of several R packages\navailable from my Github page (https://github.com/astamm).\nI was awarded a B.Sc. degree in mathematical engineering from Ecole\nCentrale de Lyon (France) and a M.Sc. degree in mathematical engineering\nwith major in statistics from Politecnico di Milano (Italy). During the\ncourse of my M.Sc., I collaborated with Dept. of Mathematics “F.\nBrioschi” (MOX) of the Politecnico di Milano and became co-investigator\nof the 2-year “Pn project” (2009-2010), whose objectives were to enable\nstatistical inference from high-dimensional data. After my M.Sc., I\nobtained a Ph.D. degree in computer science. My Ph.D. focused on the\ndevelopment and application of statistical models for the study of the\nbrain white matter microstructure and connectivity. During my first\npost-doctoral appointment at Harvard Medical School, I developed a\nstatistical framework for MR image reconstruction that guarantees\nunbiasedness of the resulting composite complex MR image. I then joined\nagain the Department of Mathematics of Politecnico di Milano where I\npursued the development of novel statistical methodologies for complex\nimage analysis and developed inferential tools for populations of\ndensities and networks.\nSimultaneously, I have been collaborating with the Dept. of\nNeuroradiology of the University Hospital of Rennes (France), since the\nbeginning of my Ph.D., and with Dept. of Radiology of BCH (USA), since\nthe beginning of my first post-doctoral appointment, to provide guidance\non designing experiments and reviewing interim data, and to advise PIs\nof most of the Dept. projects on all statistical analysis methods and\nmodel development required in their projects. During my Ph.D., I also\nworked as a biostatistician at the Dept. of Epidemiology and Public\nHealth of the University Hospital of Rennes (France) where I was in\ncharge of the statistical analyses of several health-related projects\n(e.g., multiple sclerosis, practice of oral care in palliative care\nunits).\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nOverview\nThe Large \\(P\\) small \\(n\\) project – or \\(Pn\\) project for short – aims at\nproviding inferential tools for the statistical analysis of data sets\ncharacterized by a large number of features observed on a small number\nof sample units, often referred to in the literature as high-dimensional\nmultivariate data. During the last decades, this kind of data have\nbecome very common in many active fields of research, such as medicine,\nengineering, climatology, and economics. The first application of the\nnewly developed inferential procedures will be the statistical analysis\nof the brain vascular system with the final goal of detecting\nstatistical associations between geometry, topology, hemodynamic\nspace-time patterns and the onset and rupture of cerebral aneurysms.\nConsortium\nThe scientific team behind the Large \\(P\\) small \\(n\\) project is composed\nof \\(4\\) researchers from three different institutions:\nName\nRole\nPosition\nInstitution\nSimone Vantini\nPrincipal Investigator\nAssociate Professor in Statistics\nMOX, Department of Mathematics F. Brioschi, Politecnico di Milano, Italy\nTiziano Passerini\nAssociate Investigator\nPost-Doctoral Fellow\nEmory University, USA\nAymeric Stamm\nAssociate Investigator\nPh.D. Student\nIRISA, Univ. of Rennes I, France\nAlessia Pini\nPh.D. Student\nPh.D. Student\nMOX, Department of Mathematics F. Brioschi, Politecnico di Milano, Italy\nScopes\nDuring the last decades, the phenomena investigated in many active\nfields of research (e.g., medicine, engineering, climatology, economics)\nhave become increasingly complex, providing large amount of information\nto be statistically analyzed. Consequently, the typical data set -\nprovided by scientific experiments or observations - has drifted from\nbeing characterized by a number \\(n\\) of sample units much larger than the\nnumber \\(p\\) of variables (small \\(p\\) large \\(n\\) data), to its large \\(p\\)\nsmall \\(n\\) counterpart (i.e. data sets characterized by a number \\(p\\) of\nvariables much larger than the number \\(n\\) of sample units).\nInferential statistical analysis of traditional small \\(p\\) large \\(n\\) data\noften relies on the well known central limit theorem: this theorem,\nunder very weak assumptions (i.e. independence and identical\ndistribution of the observations) guarantees the reliability of many\ncommonly used inferential statistical procedures (e.g. hypothesis\ntesting, confidence intervals, …) when the number \\(n\\) of sample units\nis far larger than the number \\(p\\) of variables.\nThe Large \\(p\\) Small \\(n\\) project aims at providing a new \\(p\\)-asymptotic\ncentral limit theorem (i.e. \\(p\\) goes to infinity with \\(n\\) finite)\nenabling inferential analysis of modern large \\(p\\) small \\(n\\) data: both\nin the \\(p\\)-discrete case (random vectors with a very large number of\ncomponents) and in the \\(p\\)-continuous case (random functions). No\nreliable inferential results are nowadays available to this purpose.\nThe achievement of such results and the development of the consequent\ninferential tools (that are going to be jointly carried out by the\nDepartment of Mathematics of Politecnico di Milano and by the IRISA\nInstitut de Recherche en Informatique et Systèmes Aléatoires, Rennes,\nFrance) will involve expertise in advanced fields of mathematics (theory\nof stochastic processes, multivariate statistics and data analysis,\nfunctional real analysis, and operator theory). In spite of this, the\npresent project aims at providing tools that will be reasonably simple\nand readily usable by any member of the scientific community (an\nautomated R library and a Microsoft Excel macro are expected to be\nprovided at the end of the project).\nThe first application of the newly developed inferential procedures will\nbe the statistical analysis of the brain vascular system of different\ngroups of patients hospitalized at the Neuroradiology Department of\nNiguarda Ca’ Granda Hospital – Milan. The final goal of the analysis is\nthe detection of statistical associations between geometry, topology,\nhemodynamic space-time patterns and the onset and rupture of cerebral\naneurysms. These associations, if found, would help neurosurgeons in the\nchoice of the patient’s best treatment, possibly decreasing the\nmortality rate due to both this pathology and to its medical treatments.\nRaw data collected at the Neuroradiology Department of Niguarda Ca’\nGranda Hospital – Milan are going to be preprocessed by the Department\nof Mathematics and Computer Science of Emory University – Atlanta, GA,\nUSA.\nState of the project\nThe Pn project was a \\(2\\)-year project that started in november 2011\nuntil december 2013 and is now over. The project partners were\nPolitecnico di Milano, Unversity of Rennes\nI and Emory\nUniversity. The project funder\nwas the 5x1000 donation program of the Politecnico di Milano. As for the\nteam members, here is what they became since the end of the project:\nSimone is now Full Professor in Statistics at the Politecnico di\nMilano, Italy.\nTiziano is now a research scientist at Siemens Corporation,\nPrinceton, USA.\nI am now a research engineer, expert in statistical information, at\nthe National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), France.\nAlessia is now Associate Professor in Statistics at the Università\ndel Sacro Cuore, Milano, Italy.\n\n\n\nPini, Alessia, Aymeric Stamm, and Simone Vantini. 2018. “Hotelling’s T2 in Separable Hilbert Spaces.” Journal of Multivariate Analysis 167: 284–305. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmva.2018.05.007.\n\n\nSecchi, Piercesare, Aymeric Stamm, and Simone Vantini. 2013. “Inference for the Mean of Large p Small n Data: A Finite-Sample High-Dimensional Generalization of Hotelling’s Theorem.” Electronic Journal of Statistics 7: 2005–31. https://doi.org/10.1214/13-EJS833.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe MS-CSI project aims at exploring the relationships between lesion\nload quantified by MRI and the individual gait pattern (IGP) computed by\nthe eGait device, which is a device jointly developed by the Department\nof Mathematics Jean Leray\n(LMJL) and the\nUmanIT company in Nantes, France.\nRationale\nIn the course of their lifetime, \\(75\\%\\) of patients diagnosed with\nmultiple sclerosis (MS) complain about reduced mobility due to walking\ndeficiencies. In clinical pratice, gait impairment is evaluated during\nthe clinical exam using mainly three indicators:\nThe time required for a patient to walk twice a distance of \\(25\\)\nfeet; this is the so-called Timed \\(25\\) Foot Walk (T25FW),\nThe walking perimeter of a patient, which is a part of the so-called\nEDSS score,\nThe cerebral and spinal lesion load, quantified by means of MR\nimaging.\nThese indicators however do not disentangle the various underlying forms\nof walking disabilities such as motor impairment, spacticity,\nequilibrium and so on.\nThe advent and development of connected devices offer a unique\nopportunity to collect non-invasive quantitative (and thus objective)\ndata about a patient’s health, at minimal cost. The UmanIT company\ntogether with the Department of Mathematics Jean Leray (LMJL) have\ndeveloped a medical device coined eGait paired with a statistical\nmethod that generates an individual gait pattern (IGP) using data\ncollected by a motion sensor. The IGP represents the evolution of hip\nrotation during a typical walking cycle. The IGP represents an objective\nbiomarker of gait impairment that is easily computed from data collected\nnon-invasively and at minimal cost. The scientific hypothesis is that\nthe IGP should share common information about gait impairment be\ncompetitive with other\nSpecific Aims\nWe focus in this project on the assessment of gait impairment. The\noriginal contributions are:\nto propose a non-invasive low-cost medical device that generates an\nindividual gait pattern for the patient during his/her clinical\nexam,\nto study the statistical associations between the provided IGP and\nthe lesion load obtained from the MRI data.\nThe project is build on mainly three specific aims:\nSpecific Aim 1\n\nTo evaluate the statistical associations between the IGP obtained\nfrom the sensor data and the lesion load obtained from the MRI data.\n\nSpecific Aim 2\n\nTo find group-level gait patterns using external sources of\ninformation such as lesion load provided by the MRI data or overall\ndisability score provided by the EDSS data.\n\nSpecific Aim 3\n\nTo explain and predict the lesion load specific to a neuronal\npathway or the membership to the previously determined groups, using\nthe IGPs.\n\nMethodology\nPatients from the OFSEP-HD cohort\nthat are seen in the University Hospital either in Nantes or Rennes will\nbe wearing the eGait device during their T25FW test for obtaining their\nindividual gait pattern (we predict \\(100\\) inclusions). As part of the\nstandard protocol of this cohort, a number of demographic and clinical\ndata will be collected as well. In addition, specific cutting-edge MRI\nsequences will be added as well for quantifying lesion load per neuronal\npathway in both the brain and the spinal cord.\nMethods for achieving SA1\n\nStatistical data integration approaches will be used to explore the\nstatistical association between IGP, clinical data and MRI data.\nThese approaches are meant to integrate different heterogeneous data\nsources by separating the common and specific information they\ncontain about the phenomenon under study.\n\nMethods for achieving SA2\n\nClustering methods adapted for functional data will be used.\nParticular attention will be paid to semi-supervised approaches to\naccount for clinical data and/or MRI data.\n\nMethods for achieving SA3\n\nFunctional-on-functional regression models will be used for\npredicting lesion load from the IGP. Scalar-on-functional regression\nmodels and supervised classification methods will be used for\npredicting group membership from the IGP.\n\nChances are that none of the existing statistical approaches will be\nstraightforwardly applicable to deal with our IGP. This is because the\nIGP is a functional data evaluating in the space of unit quaternion. As\na result, a key aspect for achieving our SAs will be to adapt existing\nor create novel statistical methods that accommodate unit quaternion\ntime series.\nExpected Applications\nThe use of advanced cerebral and spinal MRI methods, not yet used in\nclinical practice, allows one to quantify lesion load at the granularity\nof the single neuronal pathway. We ambition:\nto elaborate groupwise gait patterns (GGP) from the quantified\nlesion load obtained from the MRI data,\nto facilitate the assessment of gait impairment for patients by\nmatching his/her IGP to the closest GGP.\nThis work could have a significant impact since it could provide, during\nthe clinical exam, a specific assessment of gait impairment. This would\nprovide the neurologist with the means to propose dedicated follow-up at\nearly onset of walking deficiencies or even possibly before any\nsymptomatic discomfort. This would ultimately limit or delay aggravated\nwalking deficiencies, which is one of the main fears reported by MS\npatients.\nConsortium\nThe scientific team behind the MS-CSI project is multidisciplinary and\ncan be divided into \\(4\\) components, the member of which are listed in\nthe tables below.\nComponent 1: Statistical Modeling\nName\nQualification\nAffiliation\nAymeric STAMM\nResearch Engineer in Statistics\nCNRS (LMJL)\nLise BELLANGER\nAssociate Professor in Statistics\nNantes Univ.
