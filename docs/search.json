I am attached to the Department of\nMathematics Jean Leray, a joint CNRS and Nantes University laboratory in\nNantes, France. I am also a research fellow at the Computational\nRadiology Laboratory (CRL) affiliated to the Department of Radiology of\nBoston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, MA, USA.\nI am an experienced statistician with focus on (i) the development of\nnovel statistical methodologies for complex image analysis, with\nextensive but not exclusive application to magnetic resonance imaging of\nthe brain and (ii) the extension of traditional statistical methods\n(estimation, inference, classification, regression) to the analysis of\ncomplex data (functions, Hilbertian, tensors, networks, densities,\n…).\nI am also a research engineer with particular interest in making\nmethods and algorithms developed in research labs available for use by a\nbroader audience of applied fields. I am the author of several R\npackages available from my Github page (https://github.com/astamm).\nI was awarded a B.Sc. degree in mathematical engineering from Ecole\nCentrale de Lyon (France) and a M.Sc. degree in mathematical engineering\nwith major in statistics from Politecnico di Milano (Italy). During the\ncourse of my M.Sc., I collaborated with Dept. of Mathematics “F.\nBrioschi” (MOX) of the Politecnico di Milano and became co-investigator\nof the 2-year “Pn project” (2009-2010), whose objectives were to enable\nstatistical inference from high-dimensional data. After my M.Sc., I\nobtained a Ph.D. degree in computer science. My Ph.D. focused on the\ndevelopment and application of statistical models for the study of the\nbrain white matter microstructure and connectivity. During my first\npost-doctoral appointment at Harvard Medical School, I developed a\nstatistical framework for MR image reconstruction that guarantees\nunbiasedness of the resulting composite complex MR image. I then joined\nagain the Department of Mathematics of Politecnico di Milano where I\npursued the development of novel statistical methodologies for complex\nimage analysis and developed inferential tools for populations of\ndensities and networks.\nSimultaneously, I have been collaborating with the Dept. of\nNeuroradiology of the University Hospital of Rennes (France), since the\nbeginning of my Ph.D., and with Dept. of Radiology of BCH (USA), since\nthe beginning of my first post-doctoral appointment, to provide guidance\non designing experiments and reviewing interim data, and to advise PIs\nof most of the Dept. projects on all statistical analysis methods and\nmodel development required in their projects. During my Ph.D., I also\nworked as a biostatistician at the Dept. of Epidemiology and Public\nHealth of the University Hospital of Rennes (France) where I was in\ncharge of the statistical analyses of several health-related projects\n(e.g., multiple sclerosis, practice of oral care in palliative care\nunits).\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nOverview\nThe Large \\(P\\) small \\(n\\) project – or \\(Pn\\) project for short – aims at providing\ninferential tools for the statistical analysis of data sets\ncharacterized by a large number of features observed on a small number\nof sample units, often referred to in the literature as high-dimensional\nmultivariate data. During the last decades, this kind of data have\nbecome very common in many active fields of research, such as medicine,\nengineering, climatology, and economics. The first application of the\nnewly developed inferential procedures will be the statistical analysis\nof the brain vascular system with the final goal of detecting\nstatistical associations between geometry, topology, hemodynamic\nspace-time patterns and the onset and rupture of cerebral aneurysms.\nConsortium\nThe scientific team behind the Large \\(P\\) small \\(n\\) project is composed of \\(4\\) researchers from three different\ninstitutions:\nName\nRole\nPosition\nInstitution\nSimone Vantini\nPrincipal Investigator\nAssociate Professor in Statistics\nMOX, Department of Mathematics F.

Brioschi, Politecnico di Milano,\nItaly\nScopes\nDuring the last decades, the phenomena investigated in many active\nfields of research (e.g., medicine, engineering, climatology, economics)\nhave become increasingly complex, providing large amount of information\nto be statistically analyzed. Consequently, the typical data set -\nprovided by scientific experiments or observations - has drifted from\nbeing characterized by a number \\(n\\)\nof sample units much larger than the number \\(p\\) of variables (small \\(p\\) large \\(n\\) data), to its large \\(p\\) small \\(n\\) counterpart (i.e. data sets\ncharacterized by a number \\(p\\) of\nvariables much larger than the number \\(n\\) of sample units).\nInferential statistical analysis of traditional small \\(p\\) large \\(n\\) data often relies on the well known\ncentral limit theorem: this theorem, under very weak assumptions\n(i.e. independence and identical distribution of the observations)\nguarantees the reliability of many commonly used inferential statistical\nprocedures (e.g. hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, …) when the\nnumber \\(n\\) of sample units is far\nlarger than the number \\(p\\) of\nvariables.\nThe Large \\(p\\) Small \\(n\\) project aims at providing a new \\(p\\)-asymptotic central limit theorem\n(i.e. \\(p\\) goes to infinity with \\(n\\) finite) enabling inferential analysis\nof modern large \\(p\\) small \\(n\\) data: both in the \\(p\\)-discrete case (random vectors with a\nvery large number of components) and in the \\(p\\)-continuous case (random functions). No\nreliable inferential results are nowadays available to this purpose.\nThe achievement of such results and the development of the consequent\ninferential tools (that are going to be jointly carried out by the\nDepartment of Mathematics of Politecnico di Milano and by the IRISA\nInstitut de Recherche en Informatique et Systèmes Aléatoires, Rennes,\nFrance) will involve expertise in advanced fields of mathematics (theory\nof stochastic processes, multivariate statistics and data analysis,\nfunctional real analysis, and operator theory). In spite of this, the\npresent project aims at providing tools that will be reasonably simple\nand readily usable by any member of the scientific community (an\nautomated R library and a Microsoft Excel macro are expected to be\nprovided at the end of the project).\nThe first application of the newly developed inferential procedures\nwill be the statistical analysis of the brain vascular system of\ndifferent groups of patients hospitalized at the Neuroradiology\nDepartment of Niguarda Ca’ Granda Hospital – Milan. The final goal of\nthe analysis is the detection of statistical associations between\ngeometry, topology, hemodynamic space-time patterns and the onset and\nrupture of cerebral aneurysms. These associations, if found, would help\nneurosurgeons in the choice of the patient’s best treatment, possibly\ndecreasing the mortality rate due to both this pathology and to its\nmedical treatments.\nRaw data collected at the Neuroradiology Department of Niguarda Ca’\nGranda Hospital – Milan are going to be preprocessed by the Department\nof Mathematics and Computer Science of Emory University – Atlanta, GA,\nUSA.\nState of the project\nThe Pn project was a \\(2\\)-year\nproject that started in november 2011 until december 2013 and is now\nover.

      "contents": "\nThe MS-CSI project aims at exploring the relationships between lesion\nload quantified by MRI and the individual gait pattern (IGP) computed by\nthe eGait device, which is a device jointly developed by the Department\nof Mathematics Jean Leray (LMJL) and the UmanIT company in Nantes, France.\nRationale\nIn the course of their lifetime, \\(75\\%\\) of patients diagnosed with multiple\nsclerosis (MS) complain about reduced mobility due to walking\ndeficiencies. In clinical pratice, gait impairment is evaluated during\nthe clinical exam using mainly three indicators:\nThe time required for a patient to walk twice a distance of \\(25\\) feet; this is the so-called\nTimed \\(25\\) Foot\nWalk (T25FW),\nThe walking perimeter of a patient, which is a part of the so-called\nEDSS score,\nThe cerebral and spinal lesion load, quantified by means of MR\nimaging.\nThese indicators however do not disentangle the various underlying\nforms of walking disabilities such as motor impairment, spacticity,\nequilibrium and so on.\nThe advent and development of connected devices offer a unique\nopportunity to collect non-invasive quantitative (and thus objective)\ndata about a patient’s health, at minimal cost. The UmanIT company\ntogether with the Department of Mathematics Jean Leray (LMJL) have\ndeveloped a medical device coined eGait paired with a\nstatistical method that generates an individual gait pattern (IGP) using\ndata collected by a motion sensor. The IGP represents the evolution of\nhip rotation during a typical walking cycle. The IGP represents an\nobjective biomarker of gait impairment that is easily computed from data\ncollected non-invasively and at minimal cost. The scientific hypothesis\nis that the IGP should share common information about gait impairment be\ncompetitive with other\nSpecific Aims\nWe focus in this project on the assessment of gait impairment. The\noriginal contributions are:\nto propose a non-invasive low-cost medical device that generates an\nindividual gait pattern for the patient during his/her clinical\nexam,\nto study the statistical associations between the provided IGP and\nthe lesion load obtained from the MRI data.\nThe project is build on mainly three specific aims:\nSpecific Aim 1\n\nTo evaluate the statistical associations between the IGP obtained\nfrom the sensor data and the lesion load obtained from the MRI data.\n\nSpecific Aim 2\n\nTo find group-level gait patterns using external sources of\ninformation such as lesion load provided by the MRI data or overall\ndisability score provided by the EDSS data.\n\nSpecific Aim 3\n\nTo explain and predict the lesion load specific to a neuronal pathway\nor the membership to the previously determined groups, using the\nIGPs.\n\nMethodology\nPatients from the OFSEP-HD cohort that are\nseen in the University Hospital either in Nantes or Rennes will be\nwearing the eGait device during their T25FW test for obtaining their\nindividual gait pattern (we predict \\(100\\) inclusions). As part of the standard\nprotocol of this cohort, a number of demographic and clinical data will\nbe collected as well. In addition, specific cutting-edge MRI sequences\nwill be added as well for quantifying lesion load per neuronal pathway\nin both the brain and the spinal cord.\nMethods for achieving SA1\n\nStatistical data integration approaches will be used to explore the\nstatistical association between IGP, clinical data and MRI data. These\napproaches are meant to integrate different heterogeneous data sources\nby separating the common and specific information they contain about the\nphenomenon under study.\n\nMethods for achieving SA2\n\nClustering methods adapted for functional data will be used.\nParticular attention will be paid to semi-supervised approaches to\naccount for clinical data and/or MRI data.\n\nMethods for achieving SA3\n\nFunctional-on-functional regression models will be used for\npredicting lesion load from the IGP. Scalar-on-functional regression\nmodels and supervised classification methods will be used for predicting\ngroup membership from the IGP.\n\nChances are that none of the existing statistical approaches will be\nstraightforwardly applicable to deal with our IGP. This is because the\nIGP is a functional data evaluating in the space of unit quaternion. As\na result, a key aspect for achieving our SAs will be to adapt existing\nor create novel statistical methods that accommodate unit quaternion\ntime series.\nExpected Applications\nThe use of advanced cerebral and spinal MRI methods, not yet used in\nclinical practice, allows one to quantify lesion load at the granularity\nof the single neuronal pathway. We ambition:\nto elaborate groupwise gait patterns (GGP) from the quantified\nlesion load obtained from the MRI data,\nto facilitate the assessment of gait impairment for patients by\nmatching his/her IGP to the closest GGP.\nThis work could have a significant impact since it could provide,\nduring the clinical exam, a specific assessment of gait impairment. This\nwould provide the neurologist with the means to propose dedicated\nfollow-up at early onset of walking deficiencies or even possibly before\nany symptomatic discomfort. This would ultimately limit or delay\naggravated walking deficiencies, which is one of the main fears reported\nby MS patients.\nConsortium\nThe scientific team behind the MS-CSI project is multidisciplinary\nand can be divided into \\(4\\)\ncomponents, the member of which are listed in the tables below.\nComponent 1: Statistical Modeling\nName\nQualification\nAffiliation\nAymeric STAMM\nResearch Engineer in Statistics\nCNRS (LMJL)\nLise BELLANGER\nAssociate Professor in Statistics\nNantes Univ.
