The flipr package makes it easy and fun to perform all these inferential tasks within the permutation paradigm.\nThe central object is the so-called \\(p\\)-value function. The \\(p\\)-value function for a set of parameters \\(\\Theta\\) is a curve that represents the variation of the \\(p\\)-value of an hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis is \\(\\Theta = \\Theta_0\\) as a function of \\(\\Theta_0\\) (Martin 2017; Fraser 2019; Infanger and Schmidt-Trucksäss 2019).\nObserve that, the non-parametric combination method available in the permutation framework (Pesarin and Salmaso 2010) allows you to infer multiple parameters at once. This means that you can natively compute a single confidence region for multiple parameters that controls the family-wise error rate by construction (think of a confidence region for both the mean and the variance for instance).\nVersion 0.2.1 of the flipr package released on CRAN features \\(4\\) main functions:\nYou can compute \\(p\\)-value function when inferring multiple parameters at once via two_sample_pf();\nYou can compute a single point estimate for a single parameter of interest via two_sample_pe();\nYou can compute a confidence interval for a single parameter of interest via two_sample_ci();\nYou can automatically draw the \\(p\\)-value function for a single parameter of interest via two_sample_viz().\nThis version also implements a number of small changes and bug fixes, the full list of which is available here.\n\n\n\nFraser, D.
