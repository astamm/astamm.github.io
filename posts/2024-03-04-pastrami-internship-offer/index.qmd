## Neuroimaging context

### Traumatic brain injury (TBI)

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents 1.5 million hospital admissions in the
European Union (EU) each year and approximately 160,000 cases/year in France.
Their causes are numerous: accidents, contact sports, military
[@bhattrai2019neuroimaging], etc. It is a leading cause of injury-related death
(57,000 TBI-related deaths each year in the EU) and disability, with a
devastating impact on patients and their families [@majdan2016epidemiology]. It
is therefore of paramount importance both from a clinical standpoint and from an
ethical and societal standpoint to be able to accurately predict functional
outcomes. The PASTRAMI project aims to develop a patient-specific prediction
model for TBI functional outcomes using neuroimaging data.

### Brain microstructure and structural connectivity

The human brain is a complex organ composed of approximately 86 billion neurons
and 85 billion non-neuronal cells. The neurons are connected to each other
through synapses, which are the key elements of the brain's information
processing system. The brain's white matter (WM) is composed of axonal bundles
that connect different regions of the brain and glial cells that support and
protect the neurons. The axonal bundles are organized in a complex network of
connections, the so-called connectome. Biological parameters of interest in the
context of TBI include axonal density and mean diameter, axonal orientations,
glial cell density and mean diameter and proportion of free water. In effect,
severe TBI is often associated with axonal injury, which often translates into a
decrease in axonal density and mean diameter, and an increase in the proportion
of free water.

### Diffusion MRI

Diffusion MRI is an imaging modality sensitive to constrained water diffusion in
tissues. It is the only non-invasive imaging modality that can provide
information about the brain's microstructure and structural connectivity
[@alexander2019imaging]. In particular, using an appropriate model of the
diffusion process [@assaf2004new], the above-mentioned biological parameters of
interest can be estimated at each voxel of the brain. Once this information is
estimated, it can be used, through the process of *tractography*, to provide a
mathematical reconstruction of axonal bundles [@jeurissen2019diffusion]. The
result of all the preprocessing steps is a set of mathematical objects that
jointly represent the brain's microstructure and structural connectivity. These
objects are high-dimensional and complex, and their analysis is a challenging
task. In particular, the number of axonal bundles is not known a priori and
varies from one individual to another. This makes the comparison of a patient's
brain to healthy brains difficult.

##	Internship objectives

Mathematically, we define a **streamline** as an ordered sequence of 3D points
$x_1, \dots, x_M$. Taking the view of functional data analysis, a streamline can
be viewed as a parametrized curve $x(s) \in \mathbb{R}^3$, $s \in [0,1]$, with
$x(0) = x_1$ and $x(1) = x_M$. A white matter **fascicle** is defined as a
collection of streamlines connecting to regions of the brain and responsible for
the communication between them with the aim of performing a specific function.
In addition, at each sampled point of each streamline composing the fascicle,
one can add the information about the local microstructure (local tissue
composition: number of tissue populations and respective volumes of occupancy,
axon density, axon diameter, glial cell diameter, etc.). This information is
recovered via diffusion MRI by modeling and estimating constrained diffusion of
water in tissue with impermeable membranes and specific geometries (e.g.
cylinders or spheres) as a mixture of parametric probability distributions. If
we denote by $\mathcal{M}$ the set of such mixtures of parametrized
distributions, we can now define a **microstructure-augmented fascicle** (MAF)
as a collection of parametrized curves $f_1(s), \dots, f_N(s) \in \mathbb{R}^3
\times \mathcal{M}$, $s \in [0,1]$, with $f_i(0) = (x_1^{(i)}, p_1^{(i)})$ and
$f_i(1) = (x_M^{(i)}, p_M^{(i)})$, where $p_j^{(i)}$ is a mixture of
parametric distributions describing diffusion of water (and thus, indirectly,
microstructure) locally around the point $x_j$ on the $i$-*th* streamline.

A MAF of primary importance is the **corticospinal tract** (CST) sometimes also
referred to as the **pyramidal tract** (PyT), which is the main motor pathway in
the human brain. It is responsible for voluntary movement and connects the motor
cortex to the spinal cord. The CST is a well-known target for neurosurgical
procedures and is often affected in TBI. The method that generates MAFs from
diffusion MRI data is called **tractography** and outputs a number of
streamlines that are supposed to represent the fascicle of interest. However,
the output of tractography is highly variable and depends on the acquisition
protocol, the tractography algorithm, and the post-processing steps. This
variability makes it difficult to compare MAFs between patients and healthy
controls. The goal of the internship is to develop a statistical model for
comparing MAFs between a patient and a healthy population by building a adequate
representation of the CST via representative streamlines in such a way that this
representation be identifiable across subjects and robust to the variability of
tractography.

Care will be taken to ensure that the representation is also interpretable in
terms of the underlying microstructure. The candidate will therefore explore the
existing literature on Wasserstein barycenters for mixture models
[@peyre2019computational;@delon2020wasserstein] and propose a method to build a
representative MAF for the CST. The candidate will also explore the existing
literature on the use of functional data analysis (FDA) or topological data
analysis (TDA) for:

- clustering streamlines: in FDA, we can use the SRF or SRVF representation of 
the streamlines and apply clustering methods to such data
[@kurtek2012statistical;@srivastava2016functional]. In TDA, we can use the
persistence diagrams of the streamlines and apply clustering methods to the
persistence diagrams [@chazal2021introduction].
- comparing the representative MAF to the MAFs of the healthy population which 
can be framed either as an hypothesis testing problem or as an anomaly detection 
problem. In both cases, it is of paramount importance not only to tell if there 
are anomalies but to localize them and to provide a measure of the severity of 
the anomalies.

The candidate will implement the proposed methods and apply them to a data set
of diffusion MRI data from patients with TBI and healthy controls. The candidate
will also participate in the writing of a scientific article and the preparation
of a presentation of the results.

The internship might be extended to a PhD thesis.
