## Overview

The [**roahd**](https://astamm.github.io/roahd/index.html) (Robust Analysis of
High-dimensional Data) package [@Ieva2019] allows to use a set of statistical
tools for the exploration and robustification of univariate and multivariate
functional data sets through the use of depth-based statistical methods.

In the implementation of functions, special attention was put to their
efficiency, so that they can be profitably used also for the analysis of
high-dimensional datasets.

For a full-featured description of the package, please take a look at the
[**roahd**](https://astamm.github.io/roahd/articles/roahd.html) vignette.

## New feature

We added tools for manipulating and visualizing depthgrams
[@aleman2021visualizing]. This mathematical constructs aim at facilitating the
visualization of outliers in high dimensional functional data sets. The
[`depthgram()`](https://astamm.github.io/roahd/reference/depthGram.html)
function computes a number of depthgrams from the functional data set. An S3
specialized method for
[`plot()`](https://astamm.github.io/roahd/reference/plot.depthgram.html) makes
it possible to visualize the depthgrams and proceed with a visual inspection at
outliers.
