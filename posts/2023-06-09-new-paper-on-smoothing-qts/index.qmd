Smoothing orientation data is a fundamental task in different fields of
research. Different methods of smoothing time series in quaternion algebras have
been described in the literature, but their application is still an open point.
This paper develops a smoothing approach for smoothing quaternion time series to
obtain good performance in classification problems. Starting from an existing
method which involves an angular velocity transformation of unit quaternion time
series, a new method which employ the logarithm function to transform the
quaternion time series to a real three-dimensional time series is proposed.
Empirical evidences achieved on real data set and artificially noisy data sets
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the classical
approach based on angular velocity transformation. The R functions developed for
this paper will be provided in a Github repository.
