## Overview

The [**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/) package provides
implementations of the popular $k$-means, hierarchical agglomerative and DBSCAN
clustering methods for functional data [@ramsay2005functional]. Variability in
functional data can be divided into three components:
*amplitude*, *phase* and *ancillary* variability [@vantini2012on;@marron2015functional]. The first two sources of variability can be captured with a statistical analysis that
integrates a *curve alignment* step. The $k$-means and HAC algorithms
implemented in [**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/) provide
clustering structures that are based either on amplitude variation (default
behavior) or phase variation [@marron2014statistics]. This is achieved by
jointly performing clustering and alignment of a functional data set. The three
main related functions are
[`fdakmeans()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/fdakmeans.html)
for the $k$-means,
[`fdahclust()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/fdahclust.html)
for HAC and
[`fdadbscan()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/fdadbscan.html)
for DBSCAN.

It supports:

- functional data defined on *one-dimensional domains* but possibly evaluating in
*multivariate codomains*;
- functional data defined in arrays but also via the `fd` and `funData` classes
for functional data defined in the
[**fda**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fda) and
[**funData**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=funData) packages respectively;
- shift, dilation and affine warping functions for functional data
defined on the real line [@sangalli2010k] and all boundary-preserving warping
functions for functional data defined on a specific interval through the SRSF
framework [@tucker2013generative].

## Installation

You can install the released version of
[**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/) from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) with:

```r
install.packages("fdacluster")
```

Alternatively you can install the development version of
[**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/) from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("astamm/fdacluster")
```

## News in `v0.3.0`

* Added median centroid type;
* Median and mean centroid types are now defined on the union of individual grids;
* Simplified caps class to avoid storing objects multiple times under different names;
* Added vignette on initialization strategies for k-means;
* Added article on use case about the Berkeley growth study;
* Added article on supported input formats.
