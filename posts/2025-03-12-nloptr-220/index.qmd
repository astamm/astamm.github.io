> A new version of the [**nloptr**](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/) package
has been released!

This release fixes a breaking bug which affects **nloptr** and its reverse
dependencies and brings some minor tweaks and corrections along the way:

- Minimal patch for build against *nlopt* `2.9.x` ([#176](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/pull/176), [\@jaganmn](https://github.com/jaganmn)):
specifically, the issues were that (i) *nlopt* versions `2.9.x` had one less
algorithm in the `enum` list, namely `NLOPT_LD_LBFGS_NOCEDAL` was removed in
these versions and put back in `2.10` and (ii) we were using `inst/include` in
which we copied nlopt headers conditionally to build the package (e.g. listing
it in `PKG_CPPFLAGS`) resulting in possible version conflicts.
- Fix the 2 failed tests by adding one more termination criterion.
- Update GHA workflows to latest versions.
- Fix reverse `LinkingTo` dependencies by (i) unconditionally copying headers to `inst/include` and (ii) fixing `cmake` path search ([#179](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/pull/179), [\@astamm](https://github.com/astamm)).
- Fix for newly broken **kergp** package due to wrong usage of `if` statement
inside `paste()` which works differently than when used inside `c()`
([#180](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/pull/180),
[\@astamm](https://github.com/astamm)).
- Update artifact action to `v4`
([#174](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/pull/174),
[\@eddelbuettel](https://github.com/eddelbuettel)).
- Correcting some of the unit tests in `test-banana`
([#167](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/pull/167),
[\@aadler](https://github.com/aadler)).
- Correcting some of the unit tests in `test-global-wrapper`
([#166](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/pull/166),
[\@aadler](https://github.com/aadler)).
- Update the code in `nloptr.c` for compatibility with the `R` API, efficiency,
and formatting ([#169](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/pull/169), 
[\@aadler](https://github.com/aadler)).
- Bugfix: `ranseed` expects an unsigned long but was passed as an integer, thus
reducing the range of random seeds. It is now passed as a double and converted
to a long ([#169](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/pull/169),
[\@aadler](https://github.com/aadler)).
- Since `v2.1.1`: Fix the issue *One of the unit tests for the `isres()`
algorithm was failing on some CRAN builds because convergence is stochastic with
slightly different results even with the same fixed seed prior to calling the
function.*
