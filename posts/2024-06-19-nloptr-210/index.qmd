> A new version of the [**nloptr**](https://astamm.github.io/nloptr/) package
has been released!

This release deprecates the default behavior of the inequality equations in any
wrapper function which uses them. Currently, they are calibrated to be $\ge 0$.
This version allows for the equations to be consistent with the main `nloptr()`
function, which requires $\le 0$. In a future release, the default behavior will
switch to assuming the calibration is $\le 0$, and eventually, the $\ge 0$
behavior will be removed. It also includes a large number of safety and
efficiency changes, and an expansion of the unit tests to 100% coverage for all
files but one. The major changes include:

* Reversed the direction of the inequality equations `hin` and `hinjac` in the
wrapper functions which use them, bringing them into compliance with the main
`nloptr()` call. This addresses
[Issue #148](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/issues/148);
* Cleaned the Hock-Schittkowski problem no. 100, Hartmann 6-dimensional, and
Powell exponential examples. This addresses
[Issue #152](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/issues/152) and
[Issue #156](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/issues/156);
* Updated roxygen version;
* Updated maintainer email;
* Deal with `NA` returns from `parallel::detectCores()` (contributed by 
[\@jeroen](https://github.com/jeroen) in 
[Pull Request #150](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/pull/150);
* Setup rhub v2 checks;
* Update cmake installation instructions on Mac with brew 
[Issue #146](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/issues/146);
* Allow use of equality constraints with COBYLA 
[Issue #135](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/issues/135);
* Replaced the unit testing framework of 
[**testthat**](https://testthat.r-lib.org) with 
[**tinytest**](https://github.com/markvanderloo/tinytest?tab=readme-ov-file) 
(See [Issue #136](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/issues/136));
* Brought coverage of `is.nloptr()` to 100%. The only file not completely 
covered by unit tests is `nloptr.c`. The uncovered calls are error messages 
which get trapped by tests in R before the call gets to C;
* Linted package for code correctness and consistency;
* Updated vignette, `DESCRIPTION`, and `NEWS`;
* Updated package website to use bootstrap 5;
* Expanded unit tests: coverage now over 97% with no file below 90%;
* Removed forcing `C++11`;
* Added safety checks to C code;
* Added many safety and efficiency enhancements to R code;
* Most R code style made self-consistent;
* Updated documentation and messages for accuracy and mathematical formatting
* Updated Github actions;
* Some bugfixes (e.g. in `isres()` or the warning in `nl.grad()`).
