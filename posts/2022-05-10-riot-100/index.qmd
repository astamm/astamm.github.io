## News

In this first major release, we:

* Added support to read
[MRtrix](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/image_data.html)
`.tck/.tsf` file formats.
* Added support to read [TrackVis](http://trackvis.org/docs/?subsect=fileformat)
`.trk` file formats.
* Use only one core to compile VTK for compliance with CRAN policy (thanks to
Prof. B. Ripley).
* Added tilde expansion on file paths.

We make it the first major release as we consider that the most popular
tractography formats are now supported by
[**riot**](https://astamm.github.io/riot/). We chose by design to support only
VTK and medInria file formats for writing.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from CRAN:
```r
install.packages("riot")
```
or you can choose to install the development version from GitHub:
```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("astamm/riot")
```

The package has its own webpage: https://astamm.github.io/riot/.
