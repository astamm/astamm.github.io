Recent approaches in gait analysis involve the use of wearable motion sensors to
extract spatio-temporal parameters that characterize multiple aspects of an
individual's gait. In particular, the medical community could largely benefit
from this type of devices as they could provide the clinicians with a valuable
tool for assessing gait impairment. Motion sensor data are however complex and
there is an urgent unmet need to develop sound statistical methods for analyzing
such data and extracting clinically relevant information. In this article, we
measure gait by following the hip rotation over time and the resulting
statistical unit is a time series of unit quaternions. We explore the
possibility to form groups of patients with similar walking impairment by taking
into account their walking data and their global decease severity with
semi-supervised clustering. We generalize a compromise-based method named
hclustcompro to unit quaternion time series by combining it with the proper
dissimilarity quaternion dynamic time warping. We apply this method on patients
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis to form groups of patients with similar
walking deficiencies while accounting for the clinical assessment of their
overall disability. We also compare the compromise-based clustering approach
with the method mergeTrees that falls into a sub-class of ensemble clustering
named collaborative clustering. The results provide a first proof of both the
interest of using wearable motion sensors for assessing gait impairment and the
use of prior knowledge to guide the clustering process. It also demonstrates
that compromise-based clustering is a more appropriate approach in this context.
