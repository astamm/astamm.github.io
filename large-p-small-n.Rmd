# Overview

The Large $P$ small $n$ project -- or $Pn$ project for short -- aims at
providing inferential tools for the statistical analysis of data sets
characterized by a large number of features observed on a small number
of sample units, often referred to in the literature as high-dimensional
multivariate data. During the last decades, this kind of data have
become very common in many active fields of research, such as medicine,
engineering, climatology, and economics. The first application of the
newly developed inferential procedures will be the statistical analysis
of the brain vascular system with the final goal of detecting
statistical associations between geometry, topology, hemodynamic
space-time patterns and the onset and rupture of cerebral aneurysms.

# Consortium

The scientific team behind the Large $P$ small $n$ project is composed
of $4$ researchers from three different institutions:

# State of the project

The Pn project was a $2$-year project that started in november 2011
until december 2013 and is now over. The project partners were
[Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it), [Unversity of Rennes
I](https://www.univ-rennes1.fr) and [Emory
University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). The project funder
was the 5x1000 donation program of the Politecnico di Milano. As for the
team members, here is what they became since the end of the project:

-   Simone is now Full Professor in Statistics at the Politecnico di
    Milano, Italy.
-   Tiziano is now a research scientist at Siemens Corporation,
    Princeton, USA.
-   I am now a research engineer, expert in statistical information, at
    the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), France.
-   Alessia is now Associate Professor in Statistics at the Universit√†
    del Sacro Cuore, Milano, Italy.
