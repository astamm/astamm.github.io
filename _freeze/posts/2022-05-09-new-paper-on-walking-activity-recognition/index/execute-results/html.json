Wearable sensors are particularly appealing, as they offer the\npossibility to monitor gait in everyday life, outside a facility in which the\ncontext of evaluation biases the measure. While some wearable sensors are\npowerful enough to integrate complex walking activity recognition models,\nnon-invasive lightweight sensors do not always have the computing or memory\ncapacity to run them. In this paper, we propose a walking activity recognition\nmodel that offers a viable solution to this problem for any wearable sensors\nthat measure rotational motion of body parts. Specifically, the model was\ntrained and tuned using data collected by a motion sensor in the form of a unit\nquaternion time series recording the hip rotation over time.\n\nThis time series was then transformed into a real-valued time series of geodesic\ndistances between consecutive quaternions. Moving average and moving standard\ndeviation versions of this time series were fed to standard machine learning\nclassification algorithms. To compare the different models, we used metrics to\nassess classification performance (precision and accuracy) while maintaining the\ndetection prevalence at the level of the prevalence of walking activities in the\ndata, as well as metrics to assess change point detection capability and\ncomputation time. Our results suggest that the walking activity recognition\nmodel with a decision tree classifier yields the best compromise in terms of\nprecision and computation time.\n\nThe sensor that was used had purposely low computing and memory capacity so that\nreported performances can be thought of as the lower bounds of what can be\nachieved. Walking activity recognition is performed online, i.e., on-the-fly,\nwhich further extends the range of applicability of our model to sensors with\nvery low memory capacity.\n\nFind out more by reading our paper [@brard2022novel] which can be found at\n<https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093555>.\n",
