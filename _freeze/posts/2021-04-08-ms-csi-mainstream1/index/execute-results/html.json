It\nis important for the donors to have mainstream material that they can read to\nunderstand what scientific discoveries we were able to make thanks to their\ndonations. A first mainstream report for general audience is now available\n[here](../../ms-csi/2021-04-08-msr1/index.html). It is intended to be read by\nFrench native speakers and is thus written in French. In this troubled period of\nglobal pandemic, the MS-CSI project has been delayed and we expect it to start\nnext September 2021. However, in the meantime, a number of milestones have been\nachieved around our eGait solution that we wanted to share with our generous\ndonors and, more generally, to the general audience who care about MS.\n",
