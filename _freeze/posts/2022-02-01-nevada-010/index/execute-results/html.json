The package provides a set of matrix representations for networks so\nthat network-valued data can be transformed into matrix-valued data.\nSubsequently, a number of distances between matrices is provided as well to\nquantify how far two networks are from each other and several test statistics\nare proposed for testing equality in distribution between samples of networks\nusing exact permutation testing procedures. The permutation scheme is carried\nout by the [`flipr`](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/) package which also\nprovides a number of test statistics based on inter-point distances that play\nnicely with network-valued data. The implementation is largely made in C++ and\nthe matrix of inter- and intra-sample distances is pre-computed, which\nalleviates the computational burden often associated with permutation tests.\n\n## Pipeline\n\nNetwork-valued data are data in which the statistical unit is a network itself.\nThis is the data with which we can make inference on populations of networks\nfrom samples of networks. The\n[`nevada`](https://astamm.github.io/nevada/index.html) package proposes a\nspecific [`nvd`](https://astamm.github.io/nevada/reference/nvd.html) class to\nhandle network-valued data. Inference from such samples is made possible though\na 4-step procedure:\n\n1. Choose a suitable representation of your samples of networks.\n2. Choose a suitable distance to embed your representation into a nice metric\nspace.\n3. Choose one or more test statistics to define your alternative hypothesis.\n4. Compute an empirical permutation-based approximation of the null\ndistribution.\n\nThe package focuses for now on the two-sample testing problem and assumes that\nall networks from both samples share the same node structure.\n\nThere are two types of questions that one can ask:\n\n- Is there a difference between the distributions that generated the two\nobserved samples?\n- Can we localize the differences between the distributions on the node\nstructure?\n\nThe [`nevada`](https://astamm.github.io/nevada/index.html) package offers a\ndedicated function for answering each of these two questions:\n\n-\n[`test2_global()`](https://astamm.github.io/nevada/reference/test2_global.html);\nfor more details, please see @lovato2020,\n- [`test2_local()`](https://astamm.github.io/nevada/reference/test2_local.html);\nfor more details, please see @lovato2021.\n",
