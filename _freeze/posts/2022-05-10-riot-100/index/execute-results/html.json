Ripley).\n* Added tilde expansion on file paths.\n\nWe make it the first major release as we consider that the most popular\ntractography formats are now supported by\n[**riot**](https://astamm.github.io/riot/). We chose by design to support only\nVTK and medInria file formats for writing.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install the package directly from CRAN:\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"riot\")\n```\nor you can choose to install the development version from GitHub:\n```r\n# install.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"astamm/riot\")\n```\n\nThe package has its own webpage: https://astamm.github.io/riot/.\n",
