It\nis therefore of paramount importance both from a clinical standpoint and from an\nethical and societal standpoint to be able to accurately predict functional\noutcomes. The PASTRAMI project aims to develop a patient-specific prediction\nmodel for TBI functional outcomes using neuroimaging data.\n\n### Brain microstructure and structural connectivity\n\nThe human brain is a complex organ composed of approximately 86 billion neurons\nand 85 billion non-neuronal cells. The neurons are connected to each other\nthrough synapses, which are the key elements of the brain's information\nprocessing system. The brain's white matter (WM) is composed of axonal bundles\nthat connect different regions of the brain and glial cells that support and\nprotect the neurons. The axonal bundles are organized in a complex network of\nconnections, the so-called connectome. Biological parameters of interest in the\ncontext of TBI include axonal density and mean diameter, axonal orientations,\nglial cell density and mean diameter and proportion of free water. In effect,\nsevere TBI is often associated with axonal injury, which often translates into a\ndecrease in axonal density and mean diameter, and an increase in the proportion\nof free water.\n\n### Diffusion MRI\n\nDiffusion MRI is an imaging modality sensitive to constrained water diffusion in\ntissues. It is the only non-invasive imaging modality that can provide\ninformation about the brain's microstructure and structural connectivity\n[@alexander2019imaging]. In particular, using an appropriate model of the\ndiffusion process [@assaf2004new], the above-mentioned biological parameters of\ninterest can be estimated at each voxel of the brain. Once this information is\nestimated, it can be used, through the process of *tractography*, to provide a\nmathematical reconstruction of axonal bundles [@jeurissen2019diffusion]. The\nresult of all the preprocessing steps is a set of mathematical objects that\njointly represent the brain's microstructure and structural connectivity. These\nobjects are high-dimensional and complex, and their analysis is a challenging\ntask. In particular, the number of axonal bundles is not known a priori and\nvaries from one individual to another. This makes the comparison of a patient's\nbrain to healthy brains difficult.\n\n##\tInternship objectives\n\nMathematically, we define a **streamline** as an ordered sequence of 3D points\n$x_1, \\dots, x_M$. Taking the view of functional data analysis, a streamline can\nbe viewed as a parametrized curve $x(s) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, $s \\in [0,1]$, with\n$x(0) = x_1$ and $x(1) = x_M$. A white matter **fascicle** is defined as a\ncollection of streamlines connecting to regions of the brain and responsible for\nthe communication between them with the aim of performing a specific function.\nIn addition, at each sampled point of each streamline composing the fascicle,\none can add the information about the local microstructure (local tissue\ncomposition: number of tissue populations and respective volumes of occupancy,\naxon density, axon diameter, glial cell diameter, etc.). This information is\nrecovered via diffusion MRI by modeling and estimating constrained diffusion of\nwater in tissue with impermeable membranes and specific geometries (e.g.\ncylinders or spheres) as a mixture of parametric probability distributions. If\nwe denote by $\\mathcal{M}$ the set of such mixtures of parametrized\ndistributions, we can now define a **microstructure-augmented fascicle** (MAF)\nas a collection of parametrized curves $f_1(s), \\dots, f_N(s) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\n\\times \\mathcal{M}$, $s \\in [0,1]$, with $f_i(0) = (x_1^{(i)}, p_1^{(i)})$ and\n$f_i(1) = (x_M^{(i)}, p_M^{(i)})$, where $p_j^{(i)}$ is a mixture of\nparametric distributions describing diffusion of water (and thus, indirectly,\nmicrostructure) locally around the point $x_j$ on the $i$-*th* streamline.\n\nA MAF of primary importance is the **corticospinal tract** (CST) sometimes also\nreferred to as the **pyramidal tract** (PyT), which is the main motor pathway in\nthe human brain. It is responsible for voluntary movement and connects the motor\ncortex to the spinal cord. The CST is a well-known target for neurosurgical\nprocedures and is often affected in TBI. The method that generates MAFs from\ndiffusion MRI data is called **tractography** and outputs a number of\nstreamlines that are supposed to represent the fascicle of interest. However,\nthe output of tractography is highly variable and depends on the acquisition\nprotocol, the tractography algorithm, and the post-processing steps. This\nvariability makes it difficult to compare MAFs between patients and healthy\ncontrols. The goal of the internship is to develop a statistical model for\ncomparing MAFs between a patient and a healthy population by building a adequate\nrepresentation of the CST via representative streamlines in such a way that this\nrepresentation be identifiable across subjects and robust to the variability of\ntractography.\n\nCare will be taken to ensure that the representation is also interpretable in\nterms of the underlying microstructure. The candidate will therefore explore the\nexisting literature on Wasserstein barycenters for mixture models\n[@peyre2019computational;@delon2020wasserstein] and propose a method to build a\nrepresentative MAF for the CST. The candidate will also explore the existing\nliterature on the use of functional data analysis (FDA) or topological data\nanalysis (TDA) for:\n\n- clustering streamlines: in FDA, we can use the SRF or SRVF representation of \nthe streamlines and apply clustering methods to such data\n[@kurtek2012statistical;@srivastava2016functional]. In TDA, we can use the\npersistence diagrams of the streamlines and apply clustering methods to the\npersistence diagrams [@chazal2021introduction].\n- comparing the representative MAF to the MAFs of the healthy population which \ncan be framed either as an hypothesis testing problem or as an anomaly detection \nproblem. In both cases, it is of paramount importance not only to tell if there \nare anomalies but to localize them and to provide a measure of the severity of \nthe anomalies.\n\nThe candidate will implement the proposed methods and apply them to a data set\nof diffusion MRI data from patients with TBI and healthy controls. The candidate\nwill also participate in the writing of a scientific article and the preparation\nof a presentation of the results.\n\nThe internship might be extended to a PhD thesis.\n\n## References\n",
