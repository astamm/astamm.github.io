Check it out if you are \n  looking for a consistent, robust and easy way of doing permutation inference.\nauthor:\n  - name: Aymeric Stamm\n    url: https://astamm.github.io\n    affiliation: Department of Mathematics Jean Leray, UMR CNRS 6629\n    affiliation_url: https://www.math.sciences.univ-nantes.fr\n    orcid_id: 0000-0002-8725-3654\ndate: 04-06-2021\ncategories: [software, inference]\nbibliography: references.bib\nimage: ../../images/flipr_hex_trans.png\n---\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation framework is particularly well suited for inferential purposes\nas it allows one to do point estimation, confidence regions and hypothesis\ntests. The [**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/) package makes it easy\nand fun to perform all these inferential tasks within the permutation paradigm.\n\nThe central object is the so-called $p$-value function. The $p$-value function\nfor a set of parameters $\\Theta$ is a curve that represents the variation of the\n$p$-value of an hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis is $\\Theta =\n\\Theta_0$ as a function of $\\Theta_0$ [@martin2017; @fraser2019; @infanger2019].\n\nObserve that, the non-parametric combination method available in the permutation\nframework [@pesarin2010] allows you to infer multiple parameters at once. This\nmeans that you can natively compute a single confidence region for multiple\nparameters that controls the family-wise error rate by construction (think of a\nconfidence region for both the mean and the variance for instance).\n\nVersion 0.2.1 of the [**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/) package\nreleased on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flipr/index.html)\nfeatures $4$ main functions:\n\n-   You can compute $p$-value function when inferring multiple parameters at\nonce via `two_sample_pf()`;\n-   You can compute a single point estimate for a single parameter of interest\nvia `two_sample_pe()`;\n-   You can compute a confidence interval for a single parameter of interest via\n`two_sample_ci()`;\n-   You can automatically draw the $p$-value function for a single parameter of\ninterest via `two_sample_viz()`.\n\nThis version also implements a number of small changes and bug fixes, the full\nlist of which is available\n[here](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/news/index.html).\n\nFinally, a number of articles can be found on the dedicated website for\n[**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/): <https://astamm.github.io/flipr/>.\nThey explain in details how the permutation framework can be used for\nstatistical inference and how [**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/)\noffers easy tools for making that happen seamlessly.\n",
