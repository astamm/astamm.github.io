The implementation follows [@sangalli2010k]\nincluding improvements proposed in [@vantini2012definition].\n\nThe package is, in its current form, mainly a C++ re-implementation of the\n[**fdakma**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fdakma/index.html) package\nwhich makes it insanely faster. It will include more clustering methods in a\nnear future as well.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install the released version of\n[**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/) from\n[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) with:\n\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"fdacluster\")\n```\n\nAlternatively you can install the development version of\n[**fdacluster**](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/) from [GitHub](https://github.com/)\nwith:\n\n```r\n# install.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"astamm/fdacluster\")\n```\n",
