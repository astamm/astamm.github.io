Different methods of smoothing time series in quaternion algebras have\nbeen described in the literature, but their application is still an open point.\nThis paper develops a smoothing approach for smoothing quaternion time series to\nobtain good performance in classification problems. Starting from an existing\nmethod which involves an angular velocity transformation of unit quaternion time\nseries, a new method which employ the logarithm function to transform the\nquaternion time series to a real three-dimensional time series is proposed.\nEmpirical evidences achieved on real data set and artificially noisy data sets\nconfirm the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the classical\napproach based on angular velocity transformation. The R functions developed for\nthis paper will be provided in a Github repository.\n\nFind out more by reading our paper [@ballante2023smoothing] which can be found at\n<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-36480-y>.\n",
