Currently, they are calibrated to be $\\ge 0$.\nThis version allows for the equations to be consistent with the main `nloptr()`\nfunction, which requires $\\le 0$. In a future release, the default behavior will\nswitch to assuming the calibration is $\\le 0$, and eventually, the $\\ge 0$\nbehavior will be removed. It also includes a large number of safety and\nefficiency changes, and an expansion of the unit tests to 100% coverage for all\nfiles but one. The major changes include:\n\n* Reversed the direction of the inequality equations `hin` and `hinjac` in the\nwrapper functions which use them, bringing them into compliance with the main\n`nloptr()` call. This addresses\n[Issue #148](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/issues/148);\n* Cleaned the Hock-Schittkowski problem no. 100, Hartmann 6-dimensional, and\nPowell exponential examples. This addresses\n[Issue #152](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/issues/152) and\n[Issue #156](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/issues/156);\n* Updated roxygen version;\n* Updated maintainer email;\n* Deal with `NA` returns from `parallel::detectCores()` (contributed by \n[\\@jeroen](https://github.com/jeroen) in \n[Pull Request #150](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/pull/150);\n* Setup rhub v2 checks;\n* Update cmake installation instructions on Mac with brew \n[Issue #146](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/issues/146);\n* Allow use of equality constraints with COBYLA \n[Issue #135](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/issues/135);\n* Replaced the unit testing framework of \n[**testthat**](https://testthat.r-lib.org) with \n[**tinytest**](https://github.com/markvanderloo/tinytest?tab=readme-ov-file) \n(See [Issue #136](https://github.com/astamm/nloptr/issues/136));\n* Brought coverage of `is.nloptr()` to 100%. The only file not completely \ncovered by unit tests is `nloptr.c`. The uncovered calls are error messages \nwhich get trapped by tests in R before the call gets to C;\n* Linted package for code correctness and consistency;\n* Updated vignette, `DESCRIPTION`, and `NEWS`;\n* Updated package website to use bootstrap 5;\n* Expanded unit tests: coverage now over 97% with no file below 90%;\n* Removed forcing `C++11`;\n* Added safety checks to C code;\n* Added many safety and efficiency enhancements to R code;\n* Most R code style made self-consistent;\n* Updated documentation and messages for accuracy and mathematical formatting\n* Updated Github actions;\n* Some bugfixes (e.g. in `isres()` or the warning in `nl.grad()`).\n",
