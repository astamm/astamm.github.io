# Title explanation

## Clustering

- *Unlabeled data*: observations are not assigned to pre-existing groups;
- *Goal*: group together individuals or observations that share common features 
while ensuring the following property: 
  - observations **within** a group must be as similar as possible, 
  - observations **between** groups (belonging to different groups) must be as <span color="red">different</span> as possible.

## Clustering methods {.smaller}

::: {.callout}
## Centroid-based clustering
Clusters are represented by a *central value* or 
*centroid*. This centroid might not necessarily be one of the observations. 
These methods (e.g. `k-means`) operate in an iterative fashion in which the 
notion of similarity is derived by how close an observation is to the centroid 
of the cluster.
:::

::: {.callout}
## Hierarchical clustering
Observations that are closer in the data space are 
more related (similar) than observations that are far from each other. Clusters 
are formed by connecting observations according to their distance and clusters 
are allowed to be merged or splitted according to a cluster-based distance.
:::

::: {.callout}
## Density-based clustering
Search the data space for areas of high density of 
observations (e.g. `DBSCAN`). Clusters are defined as the areas of higher 
density within the data space compared to other regions. Observations in the 
sparse areas are usually considered to be noise and/or border points.
:::

<!-- ::: {.callout} -->
<!-- ## Model-based clustering -->
<!-- Observations should be assigned to the same cluster  -->
<!-- if they have been drawn from the same distribution. These models have a strong  -->
<!-- theoretical foundation, however they often suffer from overfitting. The most  -->
<!-- famous method uses Gaussian mixture models. -->
<!-- ::: -->

::: {.callout-tip}
## A common ingredient
All methods but model-based rely on the ability to quantify closeness / distance between observations.

::: {.callout-important}
## What if we did not know gender membership?

- Common peak of growth velocity shortly after birth
- Another smaller peak at puberty occurring:
  - At different ages for girls and for boys;
  - At different ages for each individual.

# Functional clustering

## Functional data - Notations

- We consider a random variable $X$ which takes values in $F = \{ f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{M} \}$.
- The domain $\mathcal{D}$ of the functions in $F$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Typically $\mathcal{D} = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathcal{D} = [a, b]$.
- The co-domain $\mathcal{M}$ of the functions in $F$ can be univariate or multivariate and can be either a Euclidean space or more generally a manifold. Typically, $\mathcal{M} =
\mathbb{R}^p$.
- The space $F$ is equipped with a metric $d$ so that $(F, d)$ is a metric space.

## Functional data - A simpler example {.smaller}

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"
matplot(
  t(simulated30$x), t(simulated30$y[, 1, ]), 
  type = "l", 
  xlab = "x", ylab = "y", 
  main = "Sample of 30 random curves")

## Registration of curves {.smaller}

The following properties on the functional space $F$, its metric $d$ and the set $W$ of warping functions considered for curve registration must be satisfied for a mathematically consistent registration setup [@vantini2012on]:

(a) $F = \{ f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{M} \}$ is a metric space equipped with a metric $d: F \times F \to \mathbb{R}^+$;

(b) $W$ is a subgroup — with respect to ordinary composition $\circ$ — of the group of the continuous automorphisms of $\mathcal{D}$;

(c) $\forall f \in F$ and $\forall h \in W$, we have that $f \circ h \in F$;

(d) Given any couple of elements $f_1, f_2 \in F$ and an element $h \in W$, the distance between $f_1$ and $f_2$ is invariant under the composition of $f_1$ and $f_2$ with $h$, i.e.:

$$
d(f_1, f_2) = d(f_1 \circ h, f_2 \circ h).
$$

We will refer to this property as $W$-invariance of $d$.

## The case $\mathcal{D} = \mathbb{R}$ {.smaller}

In this situation, it is not possible to perform registration over $\mathbb{R}$ and most of the time we use $W$ to be the set of affine warping functions i.e. $W = \{ h: h(t) = at+b \}$.

In this setting, it is tempting to equip $F$ with the $L^2$-distance:
$$
d_{L^2}^2(f, g) = \int_\mathbb{R} \left\| f(t) - g(t) \right\|_{\mathbb{R}^p}^2 dt.
$$

The $L^2$-distance is however **not affine-invariant**:

$$
d_{L^2}^2(f \circ h, g \circ h) = \frac{1}{a} d_{L^2}^2(f, g)
$$

A proper normalization can make it affine-invariant such as:
$$
d(f, g) = \frac{d_{L^2}(f, g)}{\| f \|_{L^2} + \| g \|_{L^2}}
$$

## The case $\mathcal{D} = [a, b]$ {.smaller}

In this situation, it is possible to perform registration over the set $W$ of **all boundary-preserving warping functions** by using the *square-root slope function* (SRSF) framework [@tucker2013generative] under the assumption that all functions $f \in F$ are **absolutely continuous**. In this case, the SRSF of a function $f \in F$ which reads:

$$
\begin{array}{rccl}
q_f : & \mathbb{R} & \to & \mathbb{R}^p \\
& t & \mapsto & \frac{\dot{f}(t)}{\sqrt{ \| \dot{f}(t) \|_{\mathbb{R}^p} }}, 
\end{array}
$$
is square-integrable and thus belong to $L^2([a,b], \mathbb{R}^p)$.

We can therefore define:
$$
d(f, g) = d_{L^2}(q_f, q_g),
$$
and one can show that $d$ is invariant under any boundary-preserving warping.

## Funct. $k$-means [@sangalli2010k] {.smaller}

::: {.callout}
## Initialization

Choose $k$ initial observations as cluster centroids.
:::

::: {.callout}
## Align observations
Perform registration of all observed curves on each cluster centroid.
:::

::: {.callout}
## Assign observations to closest centroid

Assign each observed curve to the cluster with smallest distance to its center. This involves solving a constrained mixed integer and linear programming problem to ensure that no requested cluster will be empty.
:::

::: {.callout}
## Update cluster centroids
Recompute each cluster centroid given the newly assigned observations. Since the solution to the registration problem is not unique, the *unique* centroid is computed according to recommendations in @vantini2012on to minimize total variation. If $f_0$ is a computed centroid, then define the cluster centroid as
$$
\widehat{f_0} = \arg \min_{f \in [f_0]} \sum_{i=1}^n d^2(f_i, f),
$$
which is achieved for some warping function $h^\star$ which needs to be further applied to all observations in that cluster.

## Distance matrix computation
Compute the matrix $D$ of pairwise distances between curves minimizing over the selected class $W$ of warping functions.
:::

::: {.callout}
## Dendrogram computation
Apply traditional approaches to hierarchical clustering on $D$ (either agglomerative or divisive) to build a hierarchy of possible clustering partitions of the data (dendrogram).
:::

::: {.callout}
## Assign observations to clusters
- Cut the dendrogram to form $k$ clusters and, in each cluster;

Update the distance matrix $D$ using the registered curves from previous step with no further registration. This is used for final calculations of WSS and silhouettes.

## Features {.smaller}

1. A dedicated `S3` class for storing results of clustering with amplitude and
phase separation;
2. Implementations of k-means, HAC and DBSCAN methods for functional data;
3. Built-in parallelization;
4. Tools for comparing various clustering strategies:

    - [`compare_caps()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/compare_caps.html): generates an object of class `mcaps()` containing [`caps`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/caps.html) objects for several clustering strategies;
    - [`plot()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/plot.mcaps.html) and [`autoplot()`](https://astamm.github.io/fdacluster/reference/autoplot.mcaps.html) S3 specialized methods for `mcaps` objects.

5. Integration within the R fda landscape: input grids and curves can be

    - vectors, matrices, arrays; or,
    - `fd` objects from the [**fda**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fda/index.html) package; or,
    - `funData` or `multiFunData` objects from the [**funData**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/funData/index.html) package.
