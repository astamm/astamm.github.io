Hi! Welcome to my website. I'm Aymeric (pronounced M-Rick). I am a research
engineer specialized in statistical information. My theoretical research
revolves around developing novel statistical methods for analyzing complex data,
such as manifold-valued data, network-valued data, topological data, connectome
data and so on. I am also an applied statistician with main focus in the field
of neuroscience. Lastly but not least, I believe that what we accomplish in
research, be it theoretical or applied, should be made available open-source to
a broader audience to foster a collaborative science globewise.
